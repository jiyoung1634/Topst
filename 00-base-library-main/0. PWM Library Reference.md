# PWM_Library

## Instroduction
 In this document, we'll make PWM Library to control device. This Library use file system of linux ubuntu. Some cases, you need to change path attribute to activate this library's function.

## Define
```python
export_path = "/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/export"
unexport_path = "/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/unexport"

channel_path = "/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm{}"
enable_path = "/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm{}/enable"
period_path = "/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm{}/period"
cycle_path = "/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm{}/duty_cycle"
polarity_path = "/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm{}/polarity"
```
â€» The pwm chip's number is 0. Confirm before you use this library.


export_path : file for control pwm device regist <br>
unexport_path : file for control pwm device unregist <br>
channel_path : directory genereate when pwm channel export <br>
enable_path : file for control pwm device on and off <br>
period_path : file for control pulse's period <br>
cycle_path : file for control pulse's duty cycle <br>
polarity_path : file for contorl polarity
## Function
### 1. is_exported
```python
def is_exported(channel):
    return os.path.exists(channel_path.format(channel))
```
pwm{channel} directory is exist when pwm channel is exported to kernel. So, we can check channel regist state with this directory's existence. 'os.path.exists' function return true when path is exist and return false in opposite case.

parameter value <br>
channel : pwm channel which want to confirm exported


return value <br>
true : pwm channel is exported <br>
false : pwm channel isn't exported <br>
### 2. export
```python
def export(channel):
    if(not is_exported(channel)):
        try:
            with open(export_path, 'w') as export_file:
                export_file.write(str(channel))
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error : PWm {channel} Exporting : {e}")
            sys.exit(1)
```
Write pwm channer number on export file. When we used pwm channel, it is necessary part. After this function, pwm channel's directory will generate.

parameter value <br>
channel : pwm channel number which want to export

### 3. unexport
```python
def unexport(channel):
    if (is_exported(channel)):
        try:
            with open(unexport_path, 'w') as unexport_file:
                unexport_file.write(str(channel))
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error : PWM {channel} Unexporting : {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

```
Write pwm channel number on unexport file. After this function, pwm channel's directory will be deleted. So, only use this function when you sure to do not use pwm channel which connected with pwm device.

parameter value <br>
channel : pwm channel number which want to export

### 4. set_enable
```python
def set_enable(channel, enable):
    if(is_exported(channel)):
        try:
            with open(enable_path.format(channel), 'w') as enable_file:
                enable_file.write(str(enable))
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error : PWM {channel} Enable Setting : {e}")
            sys.exit(1)    
```

Make pwm channel, Activate or Unactivate. '0' value makes device unactive. '1' value makes device active.

parameter value <br>
channel : pwm channel number which want to change active<br>
enable : active "1" or unactive "0"

### 5. set_period_ns
```python
def set_period_ns(channel, period):
    if(is_exported(channel)):
        try:
            with open(period_path.format(channel), 'w') as period_file:
                period_file.write(str(period))
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error : PWM {channel} Period Setting : {e}")
            sys.exit(1)
``` 
Control pulse period time. It means control pulse frequency with this function. This function's time unit is nano second.

parameter value <br>
channel : pwm channel number which want to control pulse period time <br>
period : time which you want set to period

### 6. set_cycle_ns
```python
def set_cycle_ns(channel, cycle):
    if(is_exported(channel)):
        try:i
            with open(cycle_path.format(channel), 'w') as cycle_file:
                cycle_file.write(str(cycle/2))
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error : PWM {channel} Duty Cycle Setting : {e}")
            sys.exit(1)
```
Control pulse's duty cycle. Duty cycle means on time within period time, so you can't set duty cycle exceed period time. When period time and duty_cycle is equal, pulse will always on. This function's time unit is nano second.

parameter value <br>
channel : pwm channel number which want to control pulse's duty cycle
cycle : period : time which you want set to duty cycle

### 7. set_period_sec
```python
def set_period_sec(channel, period):
    if(is_exported(channel)):
        try:
            with open(period_path.format(channel), 'w') as period_file:
                # on + off time
                period_file.write(str(int(period)*1000000000))
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error : PWM {channel} Period Setting : {e}")
            sys.exit(1)
```
This function is other version of set_period_ns function. This function's time unit is second.

### 8. set_cycle_sec
```python
def set_cycle_sec(channel, cycle):
    if(is_exported(channel)):
        try:
            with open(cycle_path.format(channel), 'w') as cycle_file:
                # on / on + off * 100 => duty cycle / period * 100 
                cycle_file.write(str(int(cycle)/2 *1000000000))
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error : PWM {channel} Duty Cycle Setting : {e}")
            sys.exit(1)
```
This function is other version of set_period_ns function. This function's time unit is second.

### 9. set_polarity
```python
def set_polarity(channel, polarity):
    if(is_exported(channel)):
        try:
            with open(polarity_path.format(channel), 'w') as polarity_file:
                polarity_file.write(str(polarity))
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error : PWM {channel} Polarity Setting : {e}")
            sys.exit(1)
```

channel : pwm channel number which want to change pwm signal's polarity
polarity : "normal" or "inversed" polarity
